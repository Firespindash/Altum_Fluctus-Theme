# Altum_Fluctus-Theme
A theme based on the famous painting The Great Wave of Kanagawa. \
Altum Fluctus is from Latin and means deep waves, making a reference to the painting. The entire theme colorscheme is based on the colors of the _The Great Wave of Kanagawa_. \
Yet another theme with transparent elements. It's based from the _Cyperaceae_ theme from @ZB652. \
It works for both _gtk2_ and _qt(kvantum)_ theme engines. \
This theme also includes a _Konsole_ terminal theme.

## Installation
You will need to clone it, then move it to `~/.themes` changing the name to only AltumFluctus. And move the _Konsole_ **AltumFluctus.colorscheme** file inside `~/.local/share/konsole/`. Move the colorscheme file **AltumFluctus.colors** to `~/.local/share/colors-schemes/`. And then move the files from inside the _GTK_ folder to the root folder(**AltumFluctus/**) of the theme. \

## Considerations
The theme is based on _Akava-Kv_ theme too, from @Nourepide. \
Thanks to Andrew, @ZB652, and to @Nourepide and the other contributors from the _Akava-Design_ project. \
Unfortunaly in this stage of this theme it doesn't have total _gtk3/4_ support. Nor support for _metacity/metacity-based_ window managers. Setting this theme for _gtk3/4_ too, strangely cause it to default to the original _Cyperaceae_ theme. The icon theme used on the screenshots is _Tela-circle-black-dark_, and the font is _Comfortaa_ at 16px of size. The window decoration is the default _Breeze_ theme decoration of _KDE_.
